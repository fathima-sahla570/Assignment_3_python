Assignment Overview

This assignment consists of 10 exercises aimed at developing foundational Python programming skills. 
Each exercise introduces a distinct problem-solving approach, utilizing fundamental programming constructs such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and user input/output.
This assignment is designed for beginners and covers real-world scenarios to enhance your understanding of Python.

The programs created will use clear logic, reusable methods, and precise instructions to achieve the desired outputs.
Once completed, these programs will demonstrate your proficiency in handling basic computational tasks. 
This README file provides an overview and detailed explanations for each exercise.
Exercise Overview
MonthNames.py
This program reads an integer (1â€“12) from the user and outputs the corresponding month of the year. It introduces concepts like indexing, lists, and input validation.

Cinema Ticket Pricing
The program calculates ticket costs based on age. It demonstrates decision-making using if-elif-else and the use of arithmetic operations.

BodyMassIndex.py
This program calculates BMI using user-input weight and height, then determines the BMI category. It introduces mathematical calculations and conditional checks.

Finding the Greatest of Three Numbers
The program receives three numbers from the user and determines the largest among them. This exercise focuses on comparison and the max() function.

Factorial Calculation
Using loops, the program computes the factorial of a given number, reinforcing the concept of iterative logic and multiplication.

Reverse a Number
This program reverses an integer using a while loop, enhancing understanding of digit manipulation and arithmetic operations.

Finding Multiples
The program generates multiples of a given number up to a specified range. It teaches the use of loops and modular arithmetic.

Print and Break on Keyword
The program continuously prints user input until the word "done" is entered, demonstrating infinite loops, condition checking, and loop termination.

FizzBuzz
A classic programming challenge, this program prints numbers from 1 to 10, replacing certain numbers with "Fizz," "Buzz," or "FizzBuzz.
" It introduces logic layering with modular arithmetic and conditionals.

Pattern Printing
The program prints a descending triangular pattern of numbers using nested loops, a good example of structured iteration and formatting.
